Lodo is an application that uses a tree of lists to organize many projects and to-do lists.

The application is organized into notebooks, pages and lists. Notebooks are the top level and
are displayed at the left side of the window. Pages are contained within a notebook, and within
those pages are a number of lists, which can contain items or lists of their own.

The idea behind it is to store a tree of lists, each of which can be independently manipulated to
add and move lists and items around the tree.

Items and lists are the same thing - an item is merely an empty list. In fact, everything is a list,
including notebooks and pages. This allows you to start a deep list somewhere, and if needed, move it
into its own notebook or page without any modifications.
